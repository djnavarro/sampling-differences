## Style guide

The structure of this repository is based on Danielle Navarro’s
[cogsci-template](https://github.com/djnavarro/cogsci-template) repo.

Should contains the following folders: [analysis](./analysis),
[data](./data), [experiments](./experiments), [other](./other),
[preprocessing](./preprocessing). Optionally, it may also include a
folder `models` containing modelling files, and a `writeup` folder
containing the project writeup.

If there are other resouces (e.g., OSF folders, Overleaf documents,
Google docs) that are linked to the project, they should be listed in
this document.
