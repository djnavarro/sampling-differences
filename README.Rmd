## Style guide

The structure of this repository is based on Danielle Navarro's 
[cogsci-template](https://github.com/djnavarro/cogsci-template) repo.

Should contains the following
folders: [analysis](./analysis), [data](./data), [experiments](./experiments),
[other](./other), [preprocessing](./preprocessing). Optionally, it may also 
include a folder `models` containing modelling files, and a `writeup` folder
containing the project writeup. 

If there are other resouces (e.g., OSF folders, Overleaf documents, Google docs)
that are linked to the project, they should be listed in this document.
