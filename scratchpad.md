- Initial model constructed as a simplified version of the Gaussian Process 
  model reported by Hayes et al (2019): [psyarxiv preprint](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2M83V),
  [github repository](https://github.com/djnavarro/samplingframes)
- Note added retrospectively (24 June 2021): if memory serves, at the time I 
  implemented the model in September 2020 I did toy around informally with other 
  parameter values but didn't find anything better than the settings here. I 
  did not implement any other models beside the one described
  [here](https://github.com/djnavarro/sampling-differences/blob/34966459c5c490a22fa7e9b2baddc4fca4397629/models/sampling_frames_model.R)
