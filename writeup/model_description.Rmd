\noindent
The model used in this paper is a simplified version of the one described by Hayes et al (2019; see their Appendix B). In this appendix we present a formal specification of the model (Cooper & Guest 2014), along with some comments on our implementation in R. The motivation for the model is to consider how one might learn an arbitrary smooth function $\phi : \mathcal{X} \rightarrow [0, 1]$ that assigns to every possible stimulus $x \in \mathcal{X}$ some subjective belief that $x$ possesses the unknown property. In the general case the stimulus space $\mathcal{X}$ can be richly structured, but in the current setting we can consider stimuli that vary only on a single continuous dimension.

## The prior distribution

\noindent
We specify a prior distribution over smooth functions in two parts. First, it is convenient to define a logit-transformed version of the function $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and define the prior on this transformed space:

$$
f(x) = \log \frac{\phi(x)}{1 - \phi(x)}
$$
After adopting this representation it is relatively simple to use the Gaussian process (see Rasmussen & Williams 2006) to specify a prior over possible functions $f$. In particular, although the Gaussian process is used to sample continuous functions $f$, it has the property that every finite dimensional marginalisation of the function yields a multivariate Gaussian distribution. What this means is that because we are interested in the values of $f$ only at those stimulus locations that are used in the experiment, we can work directly with this marginal prior and sample values only at those $n$ points (where $n = 6$ in this case). Letting $\bm{\mu} = (\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_n)$ denote the mean vector at these points and letting $\bm{\Sigma} = [\sigma_{ij}]$ for $i, j \in 1, \ldots, n$ define the covariance matrix, this marginal prior may be written:

$$
f(x_i) \sim \mbox{Normal}(\bm\mu, \bm\Sigma)
$$

\noindent
The covariance matrix is used to control the smoothness of the inferred function $f$ and defined by the kernel function $\sigma_{ij} = K(x_i, x_j)$. Following the logic outlined by Hayes et al, we apply a radial basis kernel function kernel in which the correlation diminishes as a Gaussian function of the distance $d_{ij}$ between items in psychological space: 

$$
K(x_i, x_j) = \tau^2 \exp\left(-\rho {d_{ij}}^2\right)
$$
and 
$$
\sigma_{ij} = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl} K(x_i, x_j) & \mbox{ if } i \neq j \\ K(x_i, x_i) + \sigma^2 & \mbox{ if } i = j \end{array}  \right.
$$
\noindent
In summary, the Gaussian process prior is described by four parameters, which have the following interpretation:

- $\mu$ is the prior mean/centrality parameter (for $\phi$), where $\mu_i = \mu$ for all $i$
- $\tau$ is a smoothness parameter and controls the baseline level of smoothness
- $\rho$ is a smoothness parameter and controls how quickly the correlation decays with psychological distance
- $\sigma$ is a prior variance parameter used to specify the extent to which the function can deviate from $\mu$

\noindent
In practice, $\mu$ and $sigma$ together play the role of "pulling" the function toward some value. The intended usage here is to impose a "regress toward zero" bias on the function: the real world is sparse, and if we sampled an arbitrary property and stimulus of psychological relevance it would be more likely that the stimulus doesn't possess that property: e.g., sample a random fruit (apple, orange, banana, etc) and some random colours (red, orange, black, etc). There are many combinations of these values that lead to property-negative statements (apples are not black, oranges are not green, etc) and only a few that are true (oranges are orange). For more discussion of sparsity biases see Navarro and Perfors (2011). 

By way of comparison, $\tau$ and $\rho$ are the parameters defining the kernel function $K$, and together they impose a bias towards smoothness. Stimuli that are near each other in psychological space should have similar inductive properties (Shepard 1987) and these two parameters work together to impose this smoothness.

## The likelihood function

\noindent
The Gaussian process prior supplies a mechanism for a Bayesian reasoner to impose two qualitatively-reasonable biases: smoothness and sparsity. What it does not provide is a learning method: how should the learner revise their prior beliefs when they observe stimuli and their properties? That role is played by the likelihood function, which describes the learners beliefs about how these observations were sampled. When constructing a likelhood, we first consider the "strong versus weak sampling" distinction introduced by Tenenbaum and Griffiths (2001). According to strong sampling, the observations are selected (somewhat randomly) *only* from a subset of possibilities that satisfies some criterion. Consider, then, a participant who has observed stimulus $x$ that is property-positve, and who understands the statistical implications of the sampling frame manipulation used in the experiment, and adopts a likelihood function that derived from a consideration of this sampling process:

- Under **property sampling** the learner assumes that this item was chosen uniformly at random from the set of property-positive stimuli. If $\phi_i$ denotes the probability (or proportion) of $x_i$ items (e.g., rocks of this specific size) that are plaxium positive, and (for simplicity) assume that the base rates of all stimulus types are the same, then the probability that a random plaxium-positive stimulus will turn out to have value $x_i$ is 
  $$
  P(x_i | \bm{\phi}) = \frac{\phi_i}{\sum_j \phi_j}
  $$
  where the sum in the denominator is taken across all possible stimuli (for these designs that's just the six test items). 

- Under **category sampling** the items are sampled uniformly at random from items that belong to the category (in this case, the category consists of 2 of the 6 test items only). If there are $|c|$ items in the category that have the same base rates, then the probability of the stimulus value $x_i$ is $1/|c|$. The probability that the item is also property positive depends on the value of $\phi_i$ and so
  $$
  P(x_i | \bm{\phi}) = \frac{\phi_i}{|c|}
  $$

\noindent  
This participant will apply a different likelihood function depending on the sampling condition. In contrast, a participant who does not consider the specifics of the sampling condition might (act as if they) believe that there is no pattern at all to how the stimuli are selected:
  
- Under **weak sampling**, items are sampled uniformly at random from all stimuli included in the experiment. In other words, it's identical to category sampling except that the "category" is larger. If $|x|$ denotes the total number of items (in this case 6)

  $$
  P(x_i | \bm{\phi}) = \frac{\phi_i}{|x|}
  $$
  An important point to note is that, because they differ only by a constant that disappears later during the normalisation phase of Bayesian belief updating (i.e., applying the denominator term in Bayes' rule), weak sampling and category sampling are in fact indistinguishable for this design. 

\noindent
In practice it is unlikely that people divide neatly into two groups. Rather, we expect there to be a continuum that describes the extent to which people are sensitive to a sampling manipulation. Navarro et al (2012) formalised this idea slightly by arguing that people might adopt a "mixed" sampling model where items are strongly sampled (be that property or category) with probability $\theta$, and weakly sampled with probability $1-\theta$. The version of the model we implement includes this $\theta$ parameter: however, because weak and category sampling are identical in this design, the only effect that $\theta$ has is to change model behaviour in the property sampling condition. Setting $\theta = 0$ produces a null effect of sampling frame (i.e., model predicts no difference between category and property sampling, and that both conditions should look like weak/category sampling), whereas $\theta = 1$ produces the largest possible effect. 

## Computing generalisation gradients

\noindent
Suppose the learner has seen a set of stimulus items $\bm x$ that are property-positive. To complete the model specification, we describe how the generalisation function emerges from the Bayesian model implied by a given prior $P(\bm{\phi}_h)$ over possible functions, and a likelihood $P(\bm x | \bm{\phi}_h)$ that describes the probability of the learner observing $\bm x$ if $\bm{\phi}_h$ is the true function. Applying Bayes' rule gives the posterior distribution 

$$ 
P({\bm \phi}_h | \bm x) = \frac{P(\bm x | \bm{\phi}_h) P(\bm{\phi}_h)}{\int P(\bm x | \bm{\phi}_h) P(\bm{\phi}_h) \ dh^\prime}
$$

\noindent
The underlying hypothesis space over possible functions $\bm \phi \in \mathcal H$ is continuous so the denominator isegrates over all possible functions. In our implementation, we approximate the full hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}$ of possible functions by considering only a finite set of possibilities, so the inference is written: 

$$ 
P({\bm \phi}_h | \bm x) \approx \frac{P(\bm x | \bm{\phi}_h) P(\bm{\phi}_h)}{\sum_{h^\prime} P(\bm x | \bm{\phi}_h) P(\bm{\phi}_h)}
$$

\noindent
This application of Bayes rule provides a posterior distribution over possible hypotheses as to the identity of the generalisation function, where the learner remains uncertain as to which function applies. Viewing this as a prediction problem, a natural way for the learner to estimate the generalisation probability $g(y_i | \bm{x})$ (i.e., the probability that new item $y_i$ possesses the property given that the items $\bm x$ possess the property) is to compute the posterior expected value of $\phi_i$. For a discrete hypothesis space:

$$
g(y_i | \bm{x}) = \sum_{h^\prime} \phi_{ih} P({\bm \phi}_h | \bm x)
$$
This completes the formal statement of the model.

## Implementation details

\noindent
For the purposes of the current paper, the model was implemented in R (R Core Team 2020) with some reliance on tidyverse functions (Wickham et al 2019). All details and documentation about the model and the R environment used to run analyses are available at the following repository: https://github.com/djnavarro/sampling-differences. Details regarding the environment weregenerated using the renv package (Ushey 2021) to aid future reproducibility. In all modelling exercises, the finite approximate hypothesis space consisted of $5^6 = 15625$ functions whose values are specified at the six stimulus values corresponding to the stimuli used in the experiment, using five possible probability values $\phi_i \in \{.1, .3, .5, .7, .9\}$ for all items.
